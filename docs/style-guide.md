# Nimibyte Academy Style Guide

## Purpose

Keep content clear, reusable, and consistent across English and Spanish publications.

## Language and localization

- Publish every article in two versions: `README.en.md` and `README.es.md`.
- Localize with intent; avoid literal translations when tone or examples break clarity.
- Add cross-links at the top of each article (`Read in English` / `Leer en Espanol`).

## Structure

- Start with problem context, then model, then practical application.
- Prefer short sections with descriptive headings.
- End with concrete takeaways or action points.
- Keep one primary argument per section.

## Writing rules

- Prefer simple and direct wording over rhetorical complexity.
- Avoid unnecessary jargon; define concepts before using acronyms.
- Use active voice whenever possible.
- Keep lists parallel and concise.

## Formatting

- Use Markdown headings in logical order (`#`, `##`, `###`).
- Use backticks for paths, folders, and code identifiers.
- Keep paragraphs short (2-5 lines).
- Use images only when they support understanding.

## Evidence and examples

- Include at least one concrete implementation example per article.
- Prefer realistic scenarios over abstract claims.
- Keep claims testable and avoid absolute statements.

## Repository conventions

- Article index file is `README.md` in the article folder.
- Article selector `README.md` links to EN and ES variants.
- Shared assets go in article-level `assets/` when specific, or repo root when global.

## Voice

- Tone: pragmatic, direct, and collaborative.
- Goal: teach decision-making, not just describe patterns.
- Bias: optimize for maintainability and delivery in real teams.
